# TCP-IP-Chat-application-
Chat Application using Socket programming as a part of my computer networking class project.

A Single Client and Single Server chat application developed by a creating a Server socket that listens on specific port number and then the client sends the request on that port number and the input and output stream that are used for reading and writing the messages.  


A multi-threaded client and server chat room like applications where multiple clients can connect to server and chat with each other this is done with the use of threads and the threads are also syncronized so that there should not be any deadlock.

We can connect any number of users by modifying the maxClientsCount variable as per our requirements.
